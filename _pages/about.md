Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year master's student at the University of Southern California, majoring in computer science. My research interests lie in on-device large language models (LLMs), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), efficient AI, optimization for machine learning, and their interdisciplinary applications.

:loudspeaker: **I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting Spring or Fall 2026. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my profile.**

In Summer 2025, I worked as a research intern in Nokiaâ€™s Wi-Fi research group, focusing on applying on-device LLMs for multi-task wireless control, with an emphasis on device-to-device communication. Prior to this, I was a member of the Wireless Devices and Systems (WiDeS) Group at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, where I conducted research on [autonomous base station deployment](https://github.com/abman23/autobs) using DRL and [context-aware Wi-Fi roaming](https://github.com/abman23/on-device-llm-wifi-roaming) through on-device LLMs.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on [multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10436965) under the supervision of Prof. [Ming Tang](https://mingtang.site/). I also gained industry experience as a software engineering intern at [Baixing AI](https://chato.cn/), where I contributed to the development of domain-specific LLM chatbots with enhanced control.
