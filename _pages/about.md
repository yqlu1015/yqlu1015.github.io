Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year master's student at the University of Southern California, majoring in computer science. My research interests lie in **edge AI**, focusing on both efficient and adaptive on-device AI models, and learning-based optimization methods for multi-agent edge systems. Ultimately, I seek to enable edge AI systems that are efficient, adaptive, and reliable in dynamic real-world settings.

:loudspeaker: **I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting Fall 2026. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my profile.**

In Summer 2025, I worked as a research intern in Nokia’s Wi-Fi research group, focusing on applying on-device LLMs for wireless control, with an emphasis on [device-to-device communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24085) and [context-aware Wi-Fi roaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04174). Prior to this, I was a member of the Wireless Devices and Systems (WiDeS) Group at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, where I conducted research on [autonomous base station deployment](https://github.com/abman23/autobs) using DRL.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on [multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10436965) under the supervision of Prof. [Ming Tang](https://mingtang.site/). I also gained industry experience as a software engineering intern at [Baixing AI](https://chato.cn/), where I contributed to the development of domain-specific LLM chatbots with enhanced control.
